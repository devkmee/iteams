# Timeline

The timeline is the right panel of a Gantt chart displaying activities in a timeline as illustrated in:

As for all Gantt components, the timeline can initialize without any configuration from the user.
But it can be customized in many ways:

- [Activity rendering](#?path=/story/guides-time-line--activity-rendering), to customize the display of activities to reflect user model properties.
- [Activities layout](./?path=/story/guides-time-line--activities-layout), to change the layout of activities, typically when several activities in the same row have the same start time.
- [Add decorations/breaks](./?path=/story/guides-time-line--decorations), to add decorations, breaks, or time markers in the time line.
- [Drag and drop of activities](./?path=/story/guides-time-line--drag-n-drop, to implement the drag-and-drop of activities.
